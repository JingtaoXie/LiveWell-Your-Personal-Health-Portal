# LiveWell - Your Health Portal Website

<img src="../asset/logo/Logo.png"></img>

Welcome to LiveWell — your personal health companion in the digital age.

LiveWell is a full-stack web platform designed to help you easily record your health data, get smart insights through analysis, and support you in making informed decisions for a healthier future. It's like having your own family doctor, right at your fingertips. I am Toby, the developer of this website, who is also a student graduated from University of Auckland. I am glad to be here and share this portal website to you.

This website consists of 8 different sub pages, each of them targets to one specific function or aims. In the rest of this file, I will choose those important page to introduce.

## `Basic Info Collecting and Modify Info Pages`

The purpose of these two pages is clear — to help you record your personal health data. But LiveWell goes a step further. Instead of only manually entering your health information, you also have a faster, smarter option: QR code scanning.
Just tap the middle button at the bottom of the screen, and you'll be taken to the scanning page. This feature automatically activates your device’s camera and scans the QR code you provide, making data input quick and effortless.

## `Analysis and Disease Prediction Pages`

In the analysis pages, you can see three algorithms that I trained for LiveWell, which are diabetes prediction algorithm, liver disease algorithm and heart disease algorithm. All these three algorithms are deep learning and neural network based.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
